              Hi! My name is Steven Ho, and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-400">ambitious</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-400">driven</span> aspiring software engineer based in Sacramento, California.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am currently in my senior year at California State University, 
              Sacramento, pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am actively seeking 
              entry-level or internship opportunities to kickstart my career
               in the tech industry.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Beyond coding, I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged. 
              From outdoor activities like tennis and football to at-home hobbies 
              like gaming and coffee making, I am always eager to explore new 
              interests.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A personal belief of mine is that everyone should{" "}
               <span className="font-bold text-teal-400">challenge</span>{" "}
               themselves to learn new things and never be afraid of what lies ahead. 
               I am motivated by the fact that there is always more to learn, 
               especially in the ever-evolving field of technology. I am excited to 
               push the boundaries of this field and to challenge myself along the way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am thrilled to be part of the tech community and eagerly anticipate 
              the growth and knowledge that await me in my career.
