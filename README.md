# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects and skills. I've developed this website as a learning experience to practice and improve my web development skills. The website is built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js

- TypeScript

## Features
- **Projects Showcase:** Displaying my projects with detailed descriptions, images, and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.
- **About Me Section:** Providing information about myself, my background, skills, and interests.
- **Contact Form:** Allowing visitors to reach out to me through a contact form.
- **Dark Mode:** Implemented a dark mode feature for better user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured the website is fully responsive and works well across different devices and screen sizes.
